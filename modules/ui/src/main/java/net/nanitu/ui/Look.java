/**
 * Pluggable rendering strategy for UI widgets.
 *
 * <p>Implement this interface to fully control the visual appearance of every widget type. Each
 * {@code draw*} method receives the widget's current state and absolute bounds, and must render
 * using only the given {@link Brush}. Every draw method must restore the brush color to
 * {@code Color.WHITE} before returning so the caller's color state is not corrupted.
 *
 * <p>Metric methods such as {@link #titleBarHeight()}, {@link #resizeHandleSize()}, and
 * {@link #borderWidth()} are called during layout and must return stable values within a single
 * frame. The framework ships a default implementation, {@link ModernFlat}, that provides a flat
 * dark style requiring no textures.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface should be stateless or immutable.
