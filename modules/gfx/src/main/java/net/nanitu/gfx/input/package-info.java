/**
 * Platform-agnostic input event system.
 *
 * <p>This package provides types for representing user input independent of
 * any windowing backend, plus pollable per-frame input state. Input events
 * extend {@link net.nanitu.event.Event} and are dispatched through the core
 * {@link net.nanitu.event.EventBus}.
 *
 * <h3>Key types</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link net.nanitu.gfx.input.event} — immutable input event records
 *       (key, mouse, scroll, resize, etc.)</li>
 *   <li>{@link net.nanitu.gfx.input.InputState} — per-frame pollable input
 *       state for game-style queries</li>
 *   <li>{@link net.nanitu.gfx.input.KeyCode} — platform-agnostic key codes
 *       based on USB HID Usage Tables</li>
 *   <li>{@link net.nanitu.gfx.input.KeyAction} — press/release/repeat enum</li>
 *   <li>{@link net.nanitu.gfx.input.MouseButton} — platform-agnostic mouse buttons</li>
 * </ul>
