/**
 * A linked shader program composed of one or more compiled {@link ShaderModule} instances.

 * minimum; geometry is optional). Compute pipelines use a single compute module. Linking resolves cross-stage
 * references and validates interface matching. Link errors are reported as exceptions at creation time.
 *
 * <p>Once linked, the program is immutable. The individual modules may be
 * retained or closed independently after linking — the linked program holds its own references to the compiled GPU
 * objects.
 *
 * <p><b>Thread safety:</b> immutable after linking — safe to read from any
 * thread.
