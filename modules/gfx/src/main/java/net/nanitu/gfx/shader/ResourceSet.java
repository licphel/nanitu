 * A set of texture/sampler and uniform-buffer bindings for a single draw call.

 * draw call needs: textures paired with samplers, and uniform buffer ranges. Each binding is placed at a numbered slot
 * that corresponds to a shader resource declaration.
 *
 * <p>Bindings are recorded lazily on the calling thread and applied in bulk
 * on the render thread when the command executes. Re-binding a slot overwrites the previous binding.
 *
 * <p><b>Thread safety:</b> recording bindings is single-threaded per instance.
 * The set does not own the resources it references — closing a resource set does not close the textures, samplers, or
 * buffers bound to it.
