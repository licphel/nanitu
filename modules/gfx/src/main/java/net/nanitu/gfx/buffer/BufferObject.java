/**
 * A GPU buffer holding vertex, index, or uniform data.
 *
 * <p>{@code BufferObject} represents a linear allocation in GPU memory that
 * the CPU can write to and the GPU can read from during draw calls or compute dispatches. The buffer's type —
 * {@code VERTEX}, {@code INDEX}, or {@code UNIFORM} — is declared once at creation time via {@link BufferObjectDesc}.
 *
 * <p><b>Lifecycle:</b>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Create with {@link Device#getBuffer device.createBuffer(desc)}.
 *   <li>Allocate storage with {@link #allocate(int, byte[])} or upload immediately
 *       with {@link #submit(byte[], int, int)} (which auto-allocates if needed).
 *   <li>Bind the buffer to an {@link Encoder} for drawing.
 *   <li>Update contents each frame with {@link #submit}.
 *   <li>Call {@link #close()} when the buffer is no longer needed.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>Buffer orphaning:</b> for {@link BufferFrequency#STREAM} buffers,
 * calling {@link #submit} with {@code offset == 0} discards the previous
 * allocation (via {@code glBufferData}) before uploading, which avoids
 * GPU pipeline stalls at the cost of an extra allocation per frame.
 *
 * <p><b>Thread safety:</b> creation and mutation must happen on the render
 * thread (or be submitted to it via the backend queue). Reading
 * {@link #desc()}, {@link #capacity()}, and {@link #canExpand()} is safe
 * from any thread.
 *
