   *       {@code libopenal.so} on Linux, and {@code libopenal.dylib} on macOS</li>
   *   <li>{@code "X11"} will search for {@code libX11.so} on Linux</li>
   *   <li>{@code "user32"} will search for {@code user32.dll} on Windows</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * @param libraryNames the bases name of the libraries without platform prefix/suffix
   * @return {@code true} if the library was found and successfully loaded into memory; {@code false} if the library
   * library could not be found, failed to load, or any of its dependencies are missing
