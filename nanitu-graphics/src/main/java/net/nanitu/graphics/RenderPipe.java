 * An immutable render pipeline that bundles all fixed-function and programmable
 * state for a draw call.

 * <p>A {@code RenderPipe} combines:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Blend state ({@link Blend})
 *   <li>Depth/stencil state ({@link Depth}, {@link Stencil})
 *   <li>Rasterization state ({@link RasterizationDesc})
 *   <li>A linked shader program
 *   <li>A vertex attribute layout ({@link VertexLayout})
 *   <li>Resource set layouts ({@link ResourceSetLayout})
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Pipelines are heavy objects that should be created once and reused across
 * many frames. They are immutable after construction.
 *
 * <p><b>Thread safety:</b> read-only after creation — safe to use from any
 * thread. The underlying GPU state is applied on the render thread during
 * command execution.
